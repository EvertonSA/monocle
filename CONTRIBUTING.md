## Understanding the design choices

Follow the [Architectural Decision Records](doc/adr/index.md) to
understand the choices made by the project.

## Run the APIv1 test (Python)

Tests rely on the Elasticsearch service so first you need to ensure the Elasticsearch container is running.
You can run the "docker-compose up -d" or you can only run the Elasticsearch container by running "docker-compose start elastic".

If you don't have docker-compose, you can start the elasticsearch service with podman by running this command:

```ShellSession
$ podman run --env discovery.type=single-node --publish 9200:9200/tcp --name elastic --rm $(awk '/docker.elastic/ { print $2 }' docker-compose.yml* | head -n 1 | sed 's/"//g')
```

Then the tests can be executed using:

```ShellSession
$ tox
```

## Update the APIv2 (protobuf)

The new APIs are defined using protobuf. To change them, first you need to update the
protobuf definitions present in the [./protos/ folder](./protos). Then you need to update
the api and web client by running the protoc command using the Makefile:

```ShellSession
$ make codegen
```

## Deploy from source code

### Using docker-compose

To use `docker-compose` from source code, use the
`docker-compose.yml.dev` file instead of the image based one:

```ShellSession
$ ln -sf docker-compose.yml.dev docker-compose.yml
```

#### Reloading code

This section explains how you can hack the Monocle code. The idea is to use
the docker deployment to avoid complex development methods.

After changes, simply run the following command. docker-compose will
rebuild and re-spawn the changed containers:

```ShellSession
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### auto-reloading the web UI code

To have your code automatically reloaded on each change, just run it
outside the container:

```ShellSession
$ docker-compose stop web
$ cd web
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Using podman to build a development environment for Monocle

Docker and Docker-compose might not be available so podman can
be used to start a Monocle deployment environment.

The helper script `contrib/start-with-podman.sh` can be used:

```Shell
contrib/start-with-podman.sh build
contrib/start-with-podman.sh create
contrib/start-with-podman.sh start
firefox http://localhost:8080
```

See the `usage` section in the script.

### Running the services manually

This section describes how to start the Monocle services directly on your host without using containers.
This can be used to better understand how the system works and to enable fast reload of local changes.

#### Requirements

```ShellSession
sudo dnf install -y nginx podman nodejs git ghc cabal-install zlib-devel python3-virtualenv python3-devel openssl-devel gcc
```

#### HTTP gateway (nginx)

Adjust and copy this configuration to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/monocle.conf`

```
server {
  listen 8081;

  gzip on;
    gzip_min_length 1000;
    gzip_types text/plain text/xml application/javascript text/css;

  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:9878/api/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
  }

  location /api/2/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:9879/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
  }

  location /auth {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:9879/auth;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
  }

  # Forward the rest to the node development server
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```

#### Elastic

```ShellSession
./contrib/start-elk.sh 9200
```

#### APIv1

```ShellSession
./contrib/start-apiv1.sh 9878
```

#### Web

```ShellSession
./contrib/start-web.sh
```

#### APIv2

```ShellSession
cd haskell
cabal repl
位> import Monocle.Api.CLI
位> run 9879 "http://localhost:9200" "../etc/config.yaml"
```

### Running the services manually using nix

This section describes how to start the Monocle services directly on your host using nix.

#### Elastic

```ShellSession
nix-shell
elk-start
```

#### Nginx

```ShellSession
nix-shell
nginx-start
```

#### APIv1

```ShellSession
nix-shell
monocle-api-start
```

#### APIv2

```ShellSession
nix-shell
monocle-api2-start
位> import Monocle.Api.CLI
位> run 19875 "http://localhost:19200" "../etc/config.yaml"
```

#### Web

```ShellSession
nix-shell
monocle-web-start
firefox http://localhost:13000
```
